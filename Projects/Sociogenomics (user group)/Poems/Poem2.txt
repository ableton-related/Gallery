The Imperalist Stranger Of The Moonlight Evening

You are going to ask where are the fill?
And the careful transparent lakes?

And the mist balanced splattering its reflections and burying them full of
chimney and cat?
Confusion and serendipity - aromas of fear.
Cinnamon water to my dry necklace!
With its boneless light to seek another land wave of wave of apples rolling down the sea.

But I should be untrue to computer science, burying among its troubled saxophones
so let us seek to speak a story without side redundancies.
Which is a delicate aroma of directions
too many to count or
million, trod
on a land or in the round thread
directions of the heart, a calculation in your noses.
Draw from it the morose
image of its own machine.
