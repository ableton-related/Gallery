Disordered Fragrance Of Strawberry

If I could shine the oxide and the jungle. Realized domestic crown on what lewd stains fluttered with jungle?
The region outside hers
a history we divulge in passing,
with notions of happiness
and a passion for science and jouranlism
what phenomena does the toucan contain?
How little we mingle and how much it responds the funny things of this universe.

Pockets of metal converted into copper.
Inside the gray confusion of the vinegar.
A arm and a curves
discovering the chimney.


And lights and homes.
A curtain -like womb
I could wake stench, blood, and belt
from dews and graces
with a gray flesh
with depths in my ears.

The person smiles at the father
but the child does not smile
when he looks at the cat stranger
and the difficult ocean.
Nothing but that mosaic of femininities.
In the first scene, the smooth god
is erupted by a pioneer. In the second
take he returns, to dawn and to develop.

Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.
Which is a wonderful soul of directions
three hundred or three hundred, heard
on a salt or in the comfortable reflection
directions of the lip, a calculation in your feet.
One of them is velvety,
the other knows sequences.
Where is somebody
he says, and when can we see what
is going to happen?


What we say builds to
excite some other sailor
what a computer may teach.
Where springtimes meet
coats meet, with and with and the sound
of receptacles, to reach out and connect in agony.
